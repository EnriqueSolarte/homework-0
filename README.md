This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and GitHub (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]


My name is Bolivar Enrique Solarte Pardo, I am from Ecuador (South America). I got my bachelor degree at the University of the Armed Forced ESPE, Republic of Ecuador 2012, in Mechatronics Engineering. Since that my passion always has been to learn and push myself forward. I finished my Master in Mechanical and Automation Engineering at National Taipei University of Technologies in Tapei-Taiwan 2017. There, I had the chance to foray into exciting fields such as machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, among others, which have become my passion and main motivation. Even though my work experience is more related to manufacturing processes and robotics, I started my Ph.D. at National Tsing Hua University in 2018, in the department of Electrical Engineering, in where my current research field is Computer Vision and Machine Learning, specifically SLAM application.
